Hello. My name is Paul Cheney, and
welcome to my course on Hands-on Response
and Design Using a CSS Preprocessor.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I teach digital media at UVU, and in my
spare time I build courses for
Pluralsight.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A CSS preprocessor allows you to use many
programming functions to build your CSS
that you may never have thought possible.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In this course, we will show you how you
create many separate files for your CSS,
and then automatically

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
combine and minify them for delivery to
the web. We will also show you the power
of using variables,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
nesting your CSS, and how to use mix ins
to automate code creation.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We will also leverage the power of
inheritance to create dry code, as well
as explore math functions, and control
directives.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is hands-on course, so you'll be
working right

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
alongside me to build a responsive,
mobile-first website for Aspen Dental.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Even if you don't like the dentist,
you're going to love the final product.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Before beginning the course you should be
familiar with HTML5, CSS3, and media
queries.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope you'll join me, and give me a
chance to convince you that using a CSS
preprocessor is the way to go.

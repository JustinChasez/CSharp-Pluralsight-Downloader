# CSharp-Pluralsight-Downloader
A Pluralsight Downloader using C#

The motive behind this project:
-----------------------------
- I have a valid subscription to pluralsight and due to internet problems and not having the money luxury to renew my subsrciptin, I wanted to save the videos locally to that I could be able to watch them later.
- Display the number of ***raters*** of a given course which is not displayed on Pluralsight website. 

The idea of this project:
-----------------------------
Simply trying to mimic ***Internet Download Manager(IDM)***, through fiddler and chrome network panel.

Things to note:
-----------------------------
 - Your feedback is highly appreciated.
 - The project may be not fully *well* *right* *configurable*, but it does the job very ***well*** and ***enough***.
 - The project is meant to run locally for simplicty(instead of save videos on the server then save them again on the user PC), debugging and extendability.
